# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a broad, rapidly evolving field, and this can be pretty intimidating to a newcomer. As someone who's gone through the process of learning machine learning by scrapping together dozens of tutorials, I want to make this process as seamless as possible for you. I've compiled notes from a slew of resources along with exercises to help you apply the skills you learn along the way.


To best maximize your experience with this guidebook, I recommend you have some prior programming experience in Python (knowledge that is roughly comparable to Berkeley's [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org/)). 

## Current Status
Right now, this book has a chapter on Reinforcement Learning, which has been curated from a plethora of resources, including UC Berkeley's AI courses and David Silver's RL course.
